  Negotiating the best price does not always guarantee a happy outcome when it
  comes to buying a car on loan. Negotiating the best financing terms always
  makes the difference when it comes to an asset that tends to depreciate in
  value from the first day.

## 1. Insufficient or Poor Credit History

Credit Card and loan providers always refer to your Credit Information Report before taking a decision on your loan application. If you have had problems repaying a debt in the past, like on a Credit Card or loan, for example, it will show up on your credit report and may result in your loan application being rejected. Remember, it is always advisable to check your Credit Score before applying for a loan or Credit Card.

Check Points On A Credit Report

* Bad Credit Score: Your Credit Score is calculated and based on your credit behaviour. The points range from 300-900. Higher points mean a better score. A score above 750 is acceptable and makes you eligible for loans. However, do note that the final decision on granting a loan or a Credit Card lies with the issuer or issuing bank.
* **Financial delinquency:** Credit Card and loan providers not only look at the type of delinquency, but they also consider how long it’s been since the non-payment of a particular loan or outstanding Credit Card bill. A 90-day late payment on your EMI or Credit Card from six years ago won’t hurt as badly as one from six months ago. So, stay on top of your payments
* > Too many Inquiries: Applying for too many Credit Cards and loans within a short period can lead to the denial of your Credit Card application.
