 It can be very frustrating, especially when access to credit is growing in the U.S. In 2016, over 12 million people gained access to credit products including credit cards, personal loans, and auto loans, according to Transunion’s Q4 2016 Industry Insights Report. While there are a wide array of Credit Cards and loan options available in the market, in reality, lenders are extremely cautious before they lend money to borrowers. Regardless of the fact that your Credit Card or loan may be pre-approved, all Credit Card issuers and loan providers adhere to their internal guidelines before sanctioning a loan or a Credit Card. This is why it is important for you to understand the major reasons why lenders reject loan or Credit Card applications. We’ve put together a list of 8 such reasons that could dampen your hopes of a successful application.

> **1. Insufficient or Poor Credit History**

Credit Card and loan providers always refer to your Credit Information Report before taking a decision on your loan application. If you have had problems repaying a debt in the past, like on a Credit Card or loan, for example, it will show up on your credit report and may result in your loan application being rejected. Remember, it is always advisable to check your Credit Score before applying for a loan or Credit Card.

**Check Points On A Credit Report**

* **Bad Credit Score:** Your Credit Score is calculated and based on your credit behaviour. The points range from 300-900. Higher points mean a better score. A score above 750 is acceptable and makes you eligible for loans. However, do note that the final decision on granting a loan or a Credit Card lies with the issuer or issuing bank.
* **Financial delinquency:** Credit Card and loan providers not only look at the type of delinquency, but they also consider how long it’s been since the non-payment of a particular loan or outstanding Credit Card bill. A 90-day late payment on your EMI or Credit Card from six years ago won’t hurt as badly as one from six months ago. So, stay on top of your payments
* **Too many Inquiries:** Applying for too many Credit Cards and loans within a short period can lead to the denial of your Credit Card application.

**To Maintain A Higher Credit Score, Follow These Rules**

**<hr>**

* Always pay your dues on time.
* Do not max out your credit limit.
* Do not take too many unsecured loans without closing out old loans.
* Avoid too many hard inquiries.
* Monitor your co-signed, guaranteed and joint accounts every month
* Check your credit report for inaccuracies from time to time

> **2. Poor Banking History or No Checking Account**

While lenders verify income documents for eligibility calculation, they also review your bank accounts to understand your banking behaviour. If you don’t own a banking account (Checking or Savings) or If the crediting of your salary is untimely or inconsistent, or you have an insufficient balance in your account that makes your cheques bounce, then you’re at risk of being denied a loan or a Credit Card. For salaried individuals, it is mandatory to provide the last six months’ salary account statement, while for self-employed individuals, the last twelve months bank statement is required. There should be no inward cheque returns and no minimum balance charges in your statement

> **3. Unstable Employment History**

Inconsistent work history could land you in trouble when applying for a Credit Card or a loan. Lenders associate job consistency with repayment capability. The minimum expectations are six months in the current job with a total work experience of more than 1 to 2 years. Switching jobs every six months may not be very well received by issuers. Additionally, you will also need to show the same consistency with regards to your residential address.

> **4. Low-Income**

A successful application also depends on whether you meet the minimum income requirement. However, this varies from lender to lender. Your application could get rejected if you do not meet the minimum income criteria set for the bank you wish to apply for a loan or Credit Card with. Even the co-borrower, whose income is considered for loan eligibility, has to meet these requirements.

> **5. Excessive Debt or High debt-to-income (DTI) ratio**

The amount of debt you currently have will also play a role in getting approved for a loan. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), your debt should not be more than 43% of your income. Once you pass that ratio, lenders are likely to deny your loan application. A good DTI is between 30% and 36%. To find out your DTI ratio, calculate your monthly gross income. Then, add up the total amount of monthly payments you make towards your debts and divide the total by your monthly gross income. For example, if you make $4,000 per month and you pay $1,500 towards other debts, your ratio would be $1,500 divided by $4,000, which is 37.5%. This would be a little on the high end, but still under the maximum amount. So, find out where your current debt-to-income ratio stands. Don’t forget that it needs to be below 43%, including your new loan payments. If you have too much debt, you’ll need to take actions such as paying it down, lowering your monthly debt payments through refinancing or increasing your gross monthly income.

> **6. Application errors**

It’s also important to ensure you fill out the loan application carefully. Small errors on the form can cause denial, and you don’t want to miss the opportunity because of an avoidable mistake. Be sure to check all of the fields carefully to ensure you enter the accurate information.
